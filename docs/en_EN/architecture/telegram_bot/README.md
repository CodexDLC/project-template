## 📦 Key Concepts

Quick access to architectural concepts.

*   **🧩 Feature-Based Architecture**
    *   Each feature is an isolated module with its own `feature_setting.py` manifest.
    *   Features are pluggable via `INSTALLED_FEATURES`.

*   **🎬 Director & Orchestrator**
    *   **Director:** Manages global navigation (switching between features).
    *   **Orchestrator:** Manages logic within a feature (Data -> UI).

*   **📱 Bot Menu (Dashboard)**
    *   A persistent "Dashboard" message.
    *   Buttons are auto-discovered from features via `MENU_CONFIG`.

*   **⚡ Async Workers (ARQ)**
    *   Background tasks (notifications, broadcasts) powered by Redis.
